# Convert string to uppercase
Suppose you have an array of strings, and you want to convert each string to uppercase using a function that returns a promise.   
You also want to log the resulting uppercase strings to the console once all the promises have resolved.  

```
const strings = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'];
logs => //[ 'FOO', 'BAR', 'BAZ' ]
```
