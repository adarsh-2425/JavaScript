//Question : Iterate over the fruits array to log 'I want to eat a' plus the name of each fruit to the console. For example, 'I want to eat a mango'.

const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];

// Iterate over fruits below
fruits.forEach(fruit => console.log('I want to eat a ' + fruit));

// Output:
// I want to eat a mango
// I want to eat a papaya
// I want to eat a pineapple
// I want to eat a apple
